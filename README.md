# Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption

This Python program allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. Users can input a message and a shift value, which will be used to perform the encryption or decryption.

## Features

- Encrypt a message using a specified shift value.
- Decrypt a message using a specified shift value.
- Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Ignores non-alphabetical characters during encryption/decryption.


## Acknowledgments

- This program is based on the Caesar Cipher algorithm, one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques.
